swc2rdf is a collection of scripts to convert the HTML data from Semantic Web conferences web sites into RDF.

These scripts has been created specifically for the RR conferences.

The process followed to create the .rdf files has been:

1. Create .txt files with from the RR web sites by copying and pasting the content and doing some manual modifications.

2. Use the scripts in utils/swc_txt2csv (you probably need to also modify this scripts) to convert the .txt to .csv. You should create one .csv file for each type of data in {chairs, papers, posters, short papers, invited talks, etc.)

3. Once you have the .csv files, use the swc2rdf/swc2rdf.py script to convert them to .rdf.
This script queries both DBLP and data.semanticweb.org SPARQL servers to extract additional data as affiliations and organizations.

To don't overload DBLP server with many queries, you can use utils/xmldumps2rdf.sh script that will download the DBLP .xml dump files and import them in a local triplestore (4store in this case). Then change the configuration swc2rdf/conf.py to use this triplestore.
