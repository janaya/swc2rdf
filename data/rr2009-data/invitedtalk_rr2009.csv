SILK:  Higher Level Rules with Defaults and Semantic Scalability;We overview the technical approach and motivations of the SILK system  for semantic rules and ontologies, that radically extends the knowledge representation (KR) power of currently commercially important business  rule systems, including not only Prologs but also production rules and event-condition-action rules, database systems, and semantic web.;http://www.rr-conference.org/RR2009/;October 25-26, 2009;Benjamin Grosof;Grosof;Vulcan Inc.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Integrating Logic Programming and Production Systems in Abductive  Logic Programming Agents;In this talk we argue the case for integrating the distinctive functionalities of logic programs and production systems within an abductive logic programming agent framework. In this framework, logic programs function as an agent's beliefs and production rules function as the agent’s goals. The semantics and proof procedures are based on abductive logic programming, in which logic programs are integrated with integrity constraints that behave like production rules. Similarly to production systems, the proof procedure is an operational semantics, which manipulates the current state of a database, which is modified by actions implemented by destructive assignment. The semantics can be viewed as generating a model, based on the sequence of database states and logic program, which makes the production rules true.;http://www.rr-conference.org/RR2009/;October 25-26, 2010;Bob;Kowalski;Department of Computing, Imperial College London, UK;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
