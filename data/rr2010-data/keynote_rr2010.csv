Query Answering under Non-Guarded Rules in Datalog+/-;Georg Gottlob;Oxford University, UK;I shall report on a recently introduced family of Datalog-based languages, called Datalog±, which is a new framework for tractable ontology querying, and for a variety of other applications. Datalog± extends plain Datalog by features such as existentially quantified rule heads, and, at the same time, restricts the rule bodies so to achieve decidability and tractability. I will review a number of theoretical results and show how Datalog± relates to both Database Dependency Theory and the Guarded Fragment of first order logic. I will show that popular tractable description logics translate into Datalog± and illustrate how this formalism can be used in the context of web data extraction, data exchange, and other applications. ;2010-09-23T14:00:00;2010-09-23T15:30:00
Data Validation with OWL Integrity Constraints;Evren Sirin;Clark & Parsia, USA;Data validation is an important part of data integration and analysis tasks. In this talk, I will describe how Web Ontology Language (OWL) can be used as an expressive language for representing constraints that must be satisfied by instance data. Specifically, the talk will focus on the issues caused by the Open World Assumption (OWA) and the absence of the Unique Name Assumption (UNA). I will present an Integrity Constraint (IC) semantics for OWL axioms and discuss how it relates to other similar proposals and epistemic Description Logics. A constraint validation algorithm based on reduction to conjunctive queries will also be presented. With the IC semantics approach, ontology modelers can choose which axioms will be interpreted with IC semantics rather than standard OWL semantics and thus combine open world reasoning with closed world constraint validation in a flexible way. ;2010-09-22T11:00:00;2010-09-22T12:30:00
